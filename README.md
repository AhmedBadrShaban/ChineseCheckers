# ChineseCheckers
Chinese checkers can be played by up to 6 players. However, we will implement only a 2 players game version for this project. The game board is basically a star with six edges. Each edge contains a different colored set of 10 marbles as seen in the above picture. The first player will own three colored sets and the second player will own the remaining three colored sets.
